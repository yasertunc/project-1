# Fellowus — Product Brief (v0)

## One-liner

Privacy-first, anonymous matching & conversation app with dynamic guide behavior across Android/iOS + Web.

## Problem

People want low-friction, safe, ephemeral conversations with strangers around intents (incident, route, social, coach) without exposing identity.

## Audience

- Travelers/commuters, local communities, lightweight coaching seekers.
- Safety-conscious users preferring pseudonyms and controlled filters.

## Value Proposition

- Anonymous, intent-filtered matching with configurable radius and capabilities (voice/text/location).
- Smart guide behaviors (wait-room ETA, calm chat cues, report flow).
- Strong A11Y/i18n baseline (EN/TR/AR) and telemetry-driven iteration.

## Pillars

1. **Privacy & Safety** (anonymous IDs, report flow, cooldowns)
2. **Fast Matching** (orchestrator + queue expansion rules)
3. **Inclusive UI** (RTL, a11y, theme)
4. **Observability** (events, metrics, dashboards)

## Out of Scope (v1)

- Persistent public profiles
- Rich media beyond text/voice placeholders
- Payments/monetization

## Success (see SUCCESS_METRICS.md)

- p95 wait time < 45s, match success > 35%, timeout < 20%

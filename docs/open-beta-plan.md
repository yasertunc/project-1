# Open Beta / Public TestFlight Plan (16.6)

## Android – Play Console Open Testing

1. Promote from internal track to **Open testing**.
2. Create storefront text for testers (privacy link, instructions).
3. Limit rollout to 10–20% initially; monitor crash rate.
4. Gather feedback via Play Console surveys + external form.

## iOS – Public TestFlight

1. Create Public Link with capacity (e.g., 1,000 testers).
2. Ensure Apple review for external testers (requires compliance metadata).
3. Share link on controlled channels (newsletter, community Discord, etc.).

## Communication

- Announce in community channels with clear expectations (beta quality, feedback path).
- Provide fallback instructions (how to revert to production).

## Metrics & Alerts

- Track install count, crash-free sessions, and retention per cohort.
- Add Sentry alerting rules specific to beta releases.

## Exit Criteria

- No P0/P1 bugs for ≥ 7 days.
- KPIs (activation, retention) meet thresholds defined in rollout plan.
- Documentation updated before moving to full production.
